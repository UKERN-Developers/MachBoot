 * HISTORY
 * Revision 2.3  88/08/08  13:47:07  rvb
 * Allocate buffers dynamically vs statically.
 * Now b[i] and i_fs and i_buf, are allocated dynamically.
 * boot_calloc(size) allocates and zeros a  buffer rounded to a NPG
 * boundary.
 * Generalize boot spec to allow, xx()/mach, xx(n,[a..h])/mach,
 * xx([a..h])/mach, ...
 * Also default "xx" if unspecified and alloc just "/mach",
 * where everything is defaulted
 * Add routine, ptol(), to parse partition letters.
